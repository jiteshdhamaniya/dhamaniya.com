As I am approaching my 30s,
I start to realise my mortality.

That its all gonna end one day,
Everything will get back into singularity.

But Man often tends to forget this,
and waste time on petty life business.

Realising, not everything I believe, can be attained,
it's only matter of how much, i can sustain.

The Sustain of whats, not material,
but what it is to have, something real.

The real which only alive can feel,
Love and Emotions, what makes you real.

Your Time to Mother, Your Time to Child,
Your Time To Father, You Time to Life.

Think of Death Bed, how you wanna be remembered,
Because we are ephemeral, and this is only what matters.

So I make my list, what I am going to do,
Putting loved ones on top and everything else will do.

Before its too late, and i don't have control,
I like to think, it is life's only goal.

Cause I am getting older, remembering what has passed,
everything will be over and nothing will ever last.

So I Approach my 30s, putting everything else at least,
To have something meaningful, and when my time comes, I can rest in peace.
