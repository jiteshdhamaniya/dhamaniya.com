A General Understanding of future is, something which is not happened yet and "will happen". or as per wikipedia

*The **future** is the [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time) after the [present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present). Its arrival is considered inevitable due to the existence of time and the [laws of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_physics). Due to the apparent nature of [reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality) and the unavoidability of the future, everything that currently [exists](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/exist) and will exist can be categorized as either permanent, meaning that it will exist forever, or temporary, meaning that it will end.*

Now let's ditch this geeky explanation of future and just say the time which will pass and all related events are future.

Now let's take a back seat and think about it again but with a time machine in our lab.

If i travel to future with my time machine which lets say take me to 2030. Now what perplexing to me is if I see "me 2030" there, how the hell I got it there ? and how could even I see "me 2030" already if I have not lived it yet.

let me explain it again, if there is me exists in 2030, does that mean I am just re-living something I have already lived ? or everything is already decided then am I a program which has to do exactly has been told, unconsciously, because hell yeah it seems like I am writing this post very consciously or more importantly what exactly is present ? because it seems like we just switching places, "me 2020" become "me 2030" after sometime, past "me 2010" become "me 2020" after 10 years. and then for future 2030 me, 2030 is present, in that Sense we all living in present ? and it's just an illusion ?

So having said that, there is no future really ? is all present, isn't it? just running parallel. But wth does that even mean ? Heebie-jeebies.

Even Einstein said something like this

*People like us who believe in physics know that the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion. Time, in other words, he said, is an illusion.*

I think it's very unsettling when you think about it.

I plan to ask the same question to some physicists and will update this post if anybody kind enough to reply to "me 2021".
